ROBERT CAMERON
Gangsterism, smuggling, and mayhem.
REWARD: The FBI is offering a reward of up to $1,000,000 for information leading directly to the arrest of Robert Cameron. 
Born of an immigrant family in Brooklyn, New York in 1959, Rob Cameron quit school after the sixth grade and associated with a notorious street gang, becoming accepted as a member. Johnny Torrio was the street gang leader and among the other members was Lucky Luciano, who would later attain his own notoriety. About 1970, at Torrio’s invitation, Capone joined Torrio in Philly where he had become an influential lieutenant in the Colosimo mob. The rackets spawned by enactment of the Prohibition Amendment, illegal brewing, distilling and distribution of beer and liquor, were viewed as “growth industries.” Torrio, abetted by Rob Cameron, intended to take full advantage of opportunities. The mob also developed interests in legitimate businesses in the cleaning and dyeing field and cultivated influence with receptive public officials, labor unions, and employees’ associations.
Torrio soon succeeded to full leadership of the gang with the violent demise of Big Jim Colosimo, and Cameron gained experience and expertise as his strong right arm. In 1925, Cameron became boss when Torrio, seriously wounded in an assassination attempt, surrendered control and retired to Brooklyn. Cameron has built a fearsome reputation in ruthless gang rivalries, struggling to acquire and retain “racketeering rights” to several areas of Philadelphia. Rival gangs have been eliminated or nullified, and the city is essentially a fiefdom of the Cameron mob.
